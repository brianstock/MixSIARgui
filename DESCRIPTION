Description: Creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for the 'MixSIAR' package.
	The GTK-based R packages that the MixSIAR GUI depends on are no longer
	supported on CRAN, so for 'MixSIAR' to remain on CRAN it was necessary to split 
	the GUI off into its own package to remain on GitHub. 'MixSIAR' is a framework
	to run Bayesian mixing models to analyze biological tracer data (i.e. stable 
	isotopes, fatty acids), which estimate the proportions of source (prey) 
	contributions to a mixture (consumer). 'MixSIAR' is not one model, but a framework 
	that allows a user to create a mixing model based on their data structure and 
	research questions, via options for fixed/random effects, source data types, 
	priors, and error terms.
